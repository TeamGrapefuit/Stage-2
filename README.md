-------------------------------------------

##CONTENTS:


 - Development_Plans.xlsx: Tab 1: Excel sheet outling the timeline of tasks completed and remaining. Tab 2: Agent-task allocation.

 - Design_Patterns.pdf: Graphical representation and explanation of the design patterns used in the software.

 - ImplementationInC++.pdf: Explanation and justification of how the code satisfies the design.

 - System Designs Diagrams: Contains the four necessary diagrams (use case diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram for a scenario, and package diagram) along with explanations of their implementation and what they convey.

 - Source Code: Contains all source and header files necessary for the program to function.

 - Executable: Contains executable to run application.

-------------------------------------------

##EXECUTABLE:
Build Instructions:
  Simply unzip the folder and open the 'Executable' folder. Double click the executable 'Grapefuit_exe' and the program will begin running. 
  
Notes:
 - Built on a Windows 10 Machine, confirmed as working for Windows 7
 - Note: Negative dollar values may be displayed when using the grants ".csv" files. This is due to the test files containing dollar amounts that exceed the maximum value that an integer data type can hold. Since a C++ integer can hold a maximum value of $2^31 = $2.15 billion, and it is unexpected that anyone will receive a grant greater than $2.15 billion, this issue was left unaddressed.
